# End-to-End-E-Commerce-Analytics-Automated-Sales-Logistics-Executive-Dashboard
📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Business Intelligence solution developed in Excel to analyze 2,400+ transactions for a retail e-commerce business. The goal was to transform fragmented transactional data into a high-level executive tool that tracks both financial health and operational efficiency.

Advanced Pivot Tables: Built a "Calculation Engine" to feed dynamic charts.

Automation: Integrated Global Slicers (Weeknum, Order Mode, Gender) using Report Connections for a fully interactive experience.

UX/UI Design: Implemented a nature-inspired, executive color palette (#748C76, #505947, #BF7F5A) to ensure readability and professional aesthetics.
